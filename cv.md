## About myself
I teach radar technology at a military university in the Republic of Belarus. In addition to teaching, I am engaged in scientific activities. Currently I am working on my Ph.D. thesis related to the adaptation of radar angle meters to the polarization of the received signal. Of the achievements, I can note the deep knowledge of the BUK air defense system, knowledge of digital technology, probability theory and matrix apparatus, a trip by sea from Belarus to Montenegro in a private car. In my free time I like to relax in nature, I am fond of spearfishing and fishing. I have a golden retriever named Gera.

## Skills
In my work I actively use such tools as the C++ programming language, the MathCad mathematical package, the CST Macroweve Studio microwave modeling environment. In my free time, I study the JavaScript programming language. Currently I have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, React, Type Script and Node JS. At the moment I am working on the transition to a higher level of proficiency in these technologies. I have knowledge of English at the level A1-A2 and I am working on its improvement.
  
## Code examples
```function rot13(message){
  //your code here
  let tempArr = message.split("").map((simb) => {
    let code = simb.charCodeAt();
    if ((code > 64 && code < 78) || (code > 96 && code < 110)) code = code + 13;
    else if ((code > 77 && code < 91) || (code > 108 && code < 123)) code -= 13;
    return String.fromCodePoint(code); //   ;
  });
  return tempArr.join("");
}
```
## work experience
I have extensive experience in modeling radar stations in C ++ while serving in the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus. I have experience in developing digital devices based on microcontrollers designed to interface with a digital computer of BUK air defense systems in C ++.
